# Pose Detection
This repository holds the tensorflow implementation of Pose Detection using Movenet in Python.
<br>
## Dataset
The model 'Movenet' is trained on MS COCO dataset available <a href="https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/dataset_zoo/index.html">here</a>
<br>
## Steps involved
- Imported the necessary libraries as mentioned in the 'Requirements' section.
- Defined the 'Movenet' model.
- Defined the function for drawing the landmarks and initialized the edges.
- Ran inference for pose detection using opencv.

## Requirements

numpy==1.21.0
<br>
opencv-python==4.5.3
<br>
tensorflow==2.5.0
<br>
matplotlib==3.4.2
